/*
Currently using this as basic concept for what a list would look like
Users don't need to sign in to use / access to this list though their are limitations such as 

No persistence 
No updating small features with list

The route for this should look as so bxoffice.co/watchlist <- this represents it not being tied to any user

user route would look something liek bxoffi.co/user/movies/[name_of_list]
